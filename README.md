## 🎛️ How to use Meine Verben? 

Well, after heading to [the web](http://www.meineverben.com), you are presented with a whole list of the verbs. Each line reffers to a specific verb and each column to a specific form of the verb according to different tenses. 

You can easily add any new verb using the template, that pops up on your screen when hitting the 'pridať sloveso +' button. The verb is then saved in the database by Node.js backend and the page is then presented with fresh updated content again.

Clicking the 'otestuj ma' button, you will be given choice of how many verbs your test should contain. The minimum is set to 5 to make the test objective, while the minimum is set the total number of verbs. Forwarding using 'Poďme na to!' button, the test is created randomly choosing the verbs and after this, the test is shown to you. Now you fill in all the empty fields and when ready, hit the 'hotovo' button. This will sent your test to the server, where it will be checked and evaluated. Afterwards, your results will be shown on your screen. Both absolute (number) and relative (percentage).

After the test, just use the 'Späť na slovesá' button to return to the main page with the list of the verbs.
